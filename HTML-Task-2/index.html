    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the software industry at an unprecedented pace. From <b>automated coding assistants</b> to <i>intelligent testing frameworks</i>, AI is reshaping how software is developed, deployed, and maintained.</p>

    <h2>Key Areas of AI Impact</h2>
    <p>AI is making significant strides in various aspects of software development:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Code Generation and Completion</li>
        <li>Bug Detection and Fixing</li>
        <li>Predictive Analytics for Project Management</li>
        <li>Natural Language Processing for Requirements Analysis</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>AI-Powered Development Tools</h2>
    <p>Tools like GitHub Copilot and OpenAI's GPT models are transforming the way developers write code. These AI assistants can generate entire functions based on comments, significantly speeding up the development process. The potential productivity boost is estimated to be around 10<sup>2</sup>%!</p>

    <p>However, it's important to note that AI tools are not replacing human developers. Instead, they're augmenting human capabilities, allowing developers to focus on more complex problem-solving and creative tasks. The concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in data centers powering these AI tools is a concern that the industry is actively addressing.</p>
